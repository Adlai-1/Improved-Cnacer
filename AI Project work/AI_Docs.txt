Before running the project do make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine before running else it will not run.

1. Joblib because its used to load the model(make sure its the current version).
2. Numpy(make sure its the latest version).
3.Flask(make sure its the current version).
4.Scikit-learn(make sure you install version 0.22.1).
NB:Please install the followimg dependencies with their corresponding versions most especially the scikit-learn version 0.22.1 Its very necessary else the project will not run.
please and please again make sure the right versions are installed else the project will not run!!

When the Server runs, it opens the html page that allows the user to input the necessary data for prediction.(NB:Dont run on Jupyter notebook.It didn't work on my machine and neither did it run on Darryls machine  when we tried it.
But however if you do and it works thats cool.)

The results are displayed with no fancy html text but just a simple sentence indicating whether the breast data entered is Malignant or Benign.
The Prediction results terminates to a '/predict' endpoint.

The input made should be soley numbers(ie. int,double or float) and not string!
Also incase your input is in the form eg: 21.99 make sure there is a . and not ,
